I am Song, a Student with a programming part-time job, Ruby on Rails Developer, Electronic Enthusiasts from China.
Living in Japan, and studying at Saitama University.
I always think I am a fresh man in the area of Computer Science, but I love programming and designing.
I like the feelings of making some new things, without any other thoughts, just for fun, for truth, for freedom.

Feel free to contact me, I like disscussing with others, two will give me more than one.
